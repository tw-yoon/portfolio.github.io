                    <strong>Date:</strong> Jun. 2024 - Nov. 2024
                    <br><br>
                    The modular puppet theater is an unstructured and interactive design created for children at the
                    Cook County Department of Corrections’ visitor center. Due to the sensitive nature of the
                    environment, the theater could not include any metal parts and needed to be easily portable to
                    accommodate various locations within the center. The design also had to be sturdy and safe for
                    children, ensuring durability and reliability during use.
                    <br><br>
                    Our team embarked on an extensive design process, beginning with over 100 sketches and user
                    experience research conducted at the Chicago Public Library. Through iterative development, we
                    created three different mockups before arriving at the final design. Using clever woodworking
                    techniques, we ensured the theater’s modular construction facilitated mobility while maintaining
                    durability and functionality.
                    <br><br>
                    This project was the biggest project out of all of the 2024 Segal summer internship projects,
                    involving a collaborative team of seven students. As co-project leader, I played a key role in
                    guiding the team through research, design, and production, resulting in a product that successfully
                    met the unique requirements of its intended space and users.

                    The locking mechanism is designed to interlock in multiple orientations, allowing the modules to be
                    separated and arranged across different areas to suit various needs. The modules have a trapezoidal
                    shape, enabling them to be aligned in a straight line or curved into a circle. The connection is
                    strong enough to prevent children from easily separating the modules but can still be dismantled by
                    at least two adults. This design balances stability with practicality, making the puppet theater
                    safe and functional.
                    <br><br>
                    To address the issue of individual modules being easy to tip over, we included slots for
                    placeholders to provide additional stability and prevent accidents. This locking system makes the
                    puppet theater both reliable and adaptable to different environments.

                    <strong>Week 1-3:</strong> My team began with research. We visited the Cook County Department of
                    Corrections to
                    understand the space and its constraints. We also visited the Chicago Public Library’s children’s
                    section, which had a puppet theater, to observe its design and functionality.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Week 4-6:</strong> We held ideation meetings with the client and Marylin Price, a master
                    puppeteer. She
                    provided critical insights into puppeteering, including the ideal size and key features of a puppet
                    theater. We generated over 100 sketches and created mockups, narrowing our ideas down to a single
                    design. During this stage, we decided to make the puppet theater modular and incorporate toy
                    elements on each side to appeal to children who might not engage with puppets.
                    We transitioned to the design phase, creating CAD drawings for individual parts, adhering to
                    design-for-machining principles to streamline assembly.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Week 7-10:</strong> The final month was dedicated to manufacturing. As the only team member
                    experienced with a
                    CNC router and woodworking, I was responsible for cutting the plywood. I cut eight 4x8 sheets of
                    0.75” plywood over the span of three weeks. I also led the module assembly process, from teaching my
                    teammates woodworking basics to developing an effective method to clamp the cut plywood pieces
                    securely while gluing. After several iterations, we successfully manufactured the modular puppet
                    theater.
